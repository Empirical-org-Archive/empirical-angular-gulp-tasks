The purpose of this repository is to have a central
location for all of the gulp tasks and development
dependencies in one place for Empirical Angular Apps.

##Tasks

The different gulp tasks are found in `/tasks`

##Installation Configuration

In your application you will need to add `empirical-angular-gulp-tasks`
as a dependency.

```

or

```bash
#Save as a production dependency
npm install empirical-angular-gulp-tasks --save
```


##Environments

Our gulp tasks module provides the idea of building
the application in different environments.
